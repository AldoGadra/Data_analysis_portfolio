Description: Homeowners often bought houses as a means to invest more on their future life, including on their children education. But how much are homeowners are willing to pay to live near a good school? This projects aims to test wether if high quality schools correlate with increased house price. I tested this OLS and GWR to capture the relationship spatial non-stationary effect. 

Original Dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/kickstarter-projects](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syuzai/perth-house-prices/data)

Skills: Data cleaning, data wrangling, data visualization, regression subset method,  OLS, and GWR.

Tools: R.

Findings:

High quality schools have a significant positive relationship with nearby house price. This relationship have spatial non-stationary. But the aforementioned effect can still be explained under global assumption using OLS.
