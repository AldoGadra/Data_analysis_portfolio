# Aldo Gadra - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hello everyone! My name is Aldo Gadra, and I am an aspiring data analyst focusing on business analytics and econometrics. I have an adequate understanding of statistics, such as data distribution, regressions, and machine learning techniques. This is also supported by my excellent grasp on data analysis tools such as Excel, Python, Tableau, and SQL. The combination of both knowledge and skill set serves as a strong foundation for me to prepare, clean, analyze, and visualize data in order to aid the data-based decision process. 

In my spare time, I enjoy doing data analysis and research on geeky pop culture topics like comics and games. Which you could find more on my Medium page [here](https://medium.com/@aldgadra). I adore investigating niche pop culture topics and gathering insights that geeks enjoy.

In this portfolio, I have included projects showcasing my analytical capability along with corresponding technical skills for business and general data analytics topics.
